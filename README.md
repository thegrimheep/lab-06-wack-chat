# Welcome to The Grim Heep Chat

1. Here's how we'll be able to chat.
  *To log on please use telnet and enter "localhost + my ip address"
  *To change your username please enter "/change username"
  *If you would like to DM a user directly, please enter "/dm + username"
  *To send everyone that is logged on, please enter "/users = your message"
  *For fun, if you would like to troll all users you can send them all the same message 10 times by entering "/troll + your message."
  *If someone gets out of hand and you feel the need to ban them you can do so by entering "/ban + username"
